SC Memories Saver ("the App") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information.

## Key Privacy Principles

### ✅ What We DO

- **No Cloud Storage** - We never upload your memories to our servers or any third-party services
- **No Account Required** - You can use the app without creating an account
- **No Data Collection** - We don't collect personal data, usage statistics, or analytics

## Data Handling

### Your Memories
When you import a Snapchat ZIP file:
1. The ZIP is processed entirely on your device
2. Data is extracted and stored in the app's local storage
3. No copies are sent anywhere
4. All data remains under your complete control

### App Files
The app stores:
- **Extracted memories** - In the app's sandboxed storage (accessible only to this app)
- **User preferences** - Export settings you configure

All stored data remains on your device and can be deleted by:
1. Deleting individual memories from within the app
2. Uninstalling the app (automatically removes all stored data)
3. Going to Settings → General → iPhone Storage → SC Memories Saver → Delete App

### Snapchat Integration
- This app does NOT authenticate with Snapchat
- We do NOT store your Snapchat credentials
- **Accurate Mode Only:** Downloads memories directly from Snapchat's CDN using publicly available URLs from your export data
- **Fast Mode:** Only processes ZIP files you manually download and import
- All Snapchat CDN communications are direct from your device to Snapchat's servers (not routed through our servers)

## In-App Purchase

When you purchase the "Unlimited Saves" premium feature:
- **Payment Processing** - Handled entirely by Apple's App Store
- **We Never See** - Your payment information, credit card details, or Apple ID
- **Apple's Policy** - Your payment information is governed by Apple's Privacy Policy
- **Receipt Verification** - We only verify the purchase occurred, no additional data is collected

## iOS Permissions

The app requests these permissions only when needed:

### File Access
- **Why:** To let you select ZIP files from your device storage
- **Scope:** Read-only access to files you explicitly select
- **What we access:** Only the ZIP files you choose to import

### Photos Access
- **Why:** To save exported memories to your Photos library
- **Scope:** Only when you explicitly tap "Save to Photos"
- **What we access:** Only your Photos library, when you initiate the save

## Security

### How We Protect Your Data
- **Sandboxed Storage** - Your memories are stored in the app's private sandbox (iOS Security)
- **No Network Transmission** - Your data never leaves your device
- **No Backups to Cloud** - Memories don't sync to iCloud or other cloud services
- **Device Encryption** - Protected by your device's built-in encryption

### Your Responsibility
- **Device Security** - Use a strong device passcode
- **Device Updates** - Keep iOS updated for security patches
- **Storage** - Ensure your device has adequate storage space

## Third-Party Services

This app does NOT integrate with any third-party services for data collection or analytics. We do not use:

- Any other tracking or analytics tools

## Data Deletion

You can delete all data associated with this app at any time:
1. **Individual Memories** - Use the app's delete function
2. **All App Data** - Uninstall the app (iOS automatically removes sandboxed data)
3. **No Recovery** - Once deleted, data cannot be recovered

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy occasionally. Changes will be effective immediately upon posting. Your continued use of the app constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
