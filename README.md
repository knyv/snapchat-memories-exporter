## Requirements

## Troubleshooting

### Choosing Between Modes
- **Accurate Mode** - Use this for most users. Downloads fresh copies with correct dates and locations (slower but best quality)
- **Fast Mode** - Use if you need quick processing and don't care about exact metadata

### "Could not read the ZIP file" error
- Ensure you downloaded the ZIP directly from Snapchat
- Try importing one ZIP file at a time
- Check that the file isn't corrupted

### Accurate mode is slow
- This is normal! Downloads are verifying each memory from Snapchat's servers
- Speed depends on your internet connection and number of memories
- Try Fast mode if you need quick processing

### "Product not available" when trying to unlock premium
- Make sure you have an active internet connection
- Restart the app
- Check that you're signed into the App Store
